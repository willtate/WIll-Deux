This project was started simply as a way to learn Java/Android development.  I
intended to make a productivity application for my own personal use; a place to
empty my brain really.  Once it was stable, I decided to release it into the
wild via the Andriod Market free of charge.  I thought this would be a better
way to run the code through its paces.

Since its free of charge I also decided to make the source code available to
help others learn.

I used the Eclipse IDE for the project, and this includes the project file to
easily import it into Eclipse.
